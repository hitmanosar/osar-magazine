                    not kid
                    ourselves here: One of the biggest draws of the Oscars is not the awards but the clothing the
                    shameless opulence in which Hollywood stars dress themselves as they applaud one another's artistry.
                    The Oscars provide a chance to wear the most legendary designers in one of the most legendary
                    venues: Los Angeles's Dolby Theatre.

                    Some of the biggest moments in the annals of fashion took place on the Academy Awards red carpet,
                    and tonight, during 2022's Academy Awards, the celebs clearly yearned to make history again. Only
                    time will tell if tonight's gowns will have the staying power of, say, Gwyneth Paltrow's bubblegum
                    taffeta dress of 1999, but never say never. After multiple awards shows darkened by the ongoing
                    coronavirus pandemic, tonight's wardrobe brought a welcome dose of radiance. Ahead, you'll find all
                    the looks of the evening, from Laverne Cox's gorgeous all black look to Rachel Zegler's Dior dress.

                    He hadn’t suddenly developed X-ray vision but his street photography subjects had overwhelmingly
                    begun
                    opting for sheer looks, even as they covered their faces with masks. The thought process, he
                    rationalizes, was, “I always wanted to do this, but I'm a little bit nervous. Now there's a little
                    bit
                    of hidden identity here, I think I can get away with it.”

                <p class="row3_p">I'm slightly ashamed to say it: I'm not very attentive to the skin on my hands. I'm
                    actively training
                    myself to fix this through small measures, such as applying SPF to the delicate area before going
                    outside or working by my sun-streamed window, and just as importantly, looking for an anti-aging
                    hand
                    cream to add to my regimen. Seemingly, hundreds of people are already far ahead of the curve;
                    according
                    to Amazon shoppers, the Salcoll Collagen Pure Bioactive Repair Hand Cream is the one formula we
                    should
                    all get our hands on.

                    In addition to retinol and hyaluronic acid, collagen is one age-defying ingredient you should search
                    for
                    within products; as one of the most abundant proteins in our bodies, collagen is responsible for the
                    elasticity and firmness of our skin. Naturally, collagen depletes with time, leading to concerns
                    like
                    sagging and wrinkles, which is why it's especially vital to feed it back into your skin.

                <p>Goth Business Casual Is the Strange New Hybrid Trend You'll Want to Naturally. <br> <br>
                    Fashion trends are always changing. What's "in" today could very well be "out" tomorrow, and
                    oftentimes
                    the most popular aesthetics are recycled and reimagined throughout the years. Some subgenres might
                    even
                    see a shift only months after their initial renaissance. For example, right now, gothcore seems to
                    be
                    transitioning into, uh, goth business casual.

                    For the record, as far as celebrity stylist Ebony Brown is concerned, gothic fashion has always been
                    in
                    style, noting that celebrities such as FKA Twigs and Zoe Kravitz have been serving us inspiration
                    for
                    this aesthetic for years. However, there are different variations of goth fashion, and today's most
                    popular interpretation dubbed "gothcore" channels all the dark and spooky elements of gothic
                    fashion, but puts an emphasis on sex appeal.

        <h4>
            Hair loss is far more common than we think, here are the top 10 causes of hair thinning</h4> <br>

                <p>Hair loss is far more common than we think, here are the top 10 causes of hair thinning
                    It's estimated that 40% of women suffer from hair loss
                    Image may contain Human Person Tool and Brush
                    SHUTTERSTOCK
                    Whether you've recently pulled a ginormous furball out of your shower drain or simply noticed a bit
                    more
                    scalp showing in your updo, hair loss is something many women experience. In fact, a study by Nioxin
                    shows that 40% of women have suffered from hair loss.

                    While many think that hair loss is only something that happens to men, hair thinning and balding
                    does
                    affect women too. With women putting so much importance on their hair (a whopping 79% of women admit
                    that their hair is a huge part of who they are), more than one in ten of those who have experienced
                    hair
                    loss have sought professional help due to the impact it had on their mental health.

                    And the sad truth is, a lot of this upset comes down to stigma. While male hair loss is regarded
                    part
                    and parcel of the ageing process for many men, for women, it is often shrouded in shame and
                    embarrassment – which really needn’t be the case. The same study shows that 59% of women with hair
                    loss
                    would hide the condition from strangers, work colleagues and even their own friends and family.
