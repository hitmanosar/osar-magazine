            <p> Multivitamins like ours that contain calcium and vitamin D provide kids with
                the primary mineral (calcium) needed for strong bones and pearly whites, and an essential vitamin (D) to

                bodies absorb the calcium.* Getting enough of this vitamin-mineral combination is especially essential
                during early childhood

                The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the global mental health crisis, all thanks to loneliness,

                According to a recent study published in The BMJ, people who contract and survive the SARS-CoV-2 virus
                even just a mild form are at a heightened risk of various mental health disorders up to a year after the
                acute phase of the illness. Those mental health problems include anxiety and depressive disorders,
                opioid use disorders, and sleep disorders, among others.

                You may consider your home a safe haven from allergens. But get this: Even though you can't necessarily
                tell by looking at it, indoor air is often twice as polluted as outdoor air thanks to dust, mold, and
                chemicals that accumulate in the enclosed space over time. That's why experts recommend investing in an
                air purifier, which is known for filtering out allergens from your home and enhancing the quality of
                your breathing air.

                "Some things like dust mites might only be in the air for 20 to 30 minutes, but if something floats
                around for hours, like cat antigen, dog antigen, cockroaches, or mold, you want an air purifier on to
                trap it," says Timothy Craig, DO, a professor at Penn State's Center for Allergy, Asthma, and
                Immunology. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are gasses from cigarette smoke, paints, furniture,
                copiers, cleaning supplies, and dry-cleaned clothes can also lead to symptoms of "sick building
                syndrome," like headaches and fatigue.

            <p> Mediterranean Diet Food List: How to Follow This Popular Meal Plan


                Unlike other diets, the Mediterranean diet doesn't have strict rules or cut out any one food group.
                Instead, it focuses on fresh produce, healthy fats, fish, and whole grains


                For the fifth year in a row, the Mediterranean diet won best overall diet in the US News & World
                Report's annual ranking, and there's a reason why: research has linked the popular way of eating to a
                longer lifespan as well as a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and age-related memory

            <img src="photo/sneeze.jpg"> <br> <br>


            <p>Some sneezes are meant to clear irritants from our nasal passages. However, some people sneeze for more
                unusual reasons.

                with a peculiar tickle in your nose, quickly building to an explosive and satisfying blast out of your
                mouth and nose. But why do we sneeze?

                As it turns out, sneezing is your body's way of getting rid of visible or microscopic allergens,
                viruses, and irritants, says Matthew Purkey, MD, an ear, nose, and throat doctor practicing in Hoffman
                Estates, Illinois for Duly Health and Care.

                When our upper airway, especially our nose, senses a foreign substance that is potentially harmful, we
                sneeze in response to expel the substance back out," he tells Health.

            <p>Both can make you sick, but here's what separates the two. <br>Viruses and bacteria are all around us.
                While we can't see them with the naked eye in fact, viruses are submicroscopic, meaning you can't even
                see them in the microscope, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute they can certainly
                make themselves known if they infect us.

                Viruses are tiny organisms made of genetic material called nucleic acid either DNA or RNA, per the
                National Human Genome Research Institute that is surrounded by a coat of protein, Charles Bailey, MD,

            <img src="photo/wheezing.jpg"> <br> <br>


            <p>Wheezing can be a sign of a serious underlying issue. <br>
                Wheezing is a high-pitched sound that's made during breathing, according to MedlinePlus. It usually
                sounds "almost like a whistle," Shweta Sood, MD, a pulmonologist at Penn Medicine, tells Health. The
                sound is most obvious when exhaling, but it may also be heard when inhaling.

                The wheezing sound happens when air moves through narrowed passageways. That narrowing and inflammation
                can occur in any part of the airway, from your lungs up to your throat, per the Mayo Clinic, but it most
                often affects the small breathing tubes (aka, bronchial tubes) deep in the lungs.

            <h4>Alcohol-Related Deaths Jumped by More Than 25% in the First Year of the Pandemic
                Just under 100,000 Americans died from an alcohol-related cause in 2020.</h4> <br> <br>

            <p>According to new research, the number of alcohol-related deaths in the U.S. increased by 25.5% between
                2019 and 2020, encompassing the first year of major COVID-19 spread. In 2019, there were 78,927 deaths
                linked to alcohol in the U.S. In 2020, there were 99,017. The average annual increase in deaths
                involving alcohol was 2.2% between 1999 and 2017, meaning the recent surge was significantly higher than
                usual.

                The study, published Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, used mortality data
                provided by the National Center for Health Statistics for people aged 16 and older. The specific way
                alcohol contributed to these deaths varied. For instance, the number of these deaths with an underlying
                cause of alcohol-related mental and behavioral disorders increased from 11,261 deaths in 2019 to 15,211
                in 2020. This marks a 35% increase. But the number of opioid overdose deaths that had alcohol as a
                contributing factor jumped even more—from 8,503 to 11,969, or around 41%. </p>

                Trusted since the 1930s, RESCUE is the handy companion you can always rely on. <br> <br>
                It’s well established that our emotional wellbeing is linked to how we cope with the pressures of
                everyday life. And with our 24/7 connected lifestyles, we’re feeling the strain more than ever. This in
                turn affects our ability to switch off at night, depriving us of the restorative benefits of sleep,
                making us less able to cope during the day. Unless we take action, this can turn into a vicious cycle.

                Introducing Rescue
                Discovered in the 1930s by Dr Edward Bach, the RESCUE formula combines five natural flower essences and
                is still made using handpicked flowers from his UK gardens in Oxfordshire. Find comfort and support in
                times of emotional demand. Keep a dropper on your desk or in your handbag to call on as needed or try
                the convenient spray.

                Restful routine
                When it comes to bedtime, start your restful routine by taking RESCUE Night. This combines the original
                RESCUE formula with the additional White Chestnut essence, long used to help switch off unwanted
                thoughts. Disconnect from the distractions and awake refreshed.

                Need more energy? Want to optimise your immune system? This award-winning range of plant-based
                supplements could help with those concerns and more <br> <br>In recent years, we‘ve all become a lot
                more aware of natural health and wellbeing. As a result, we‘re a lot more discerning about what we put
                in and on our bodies. We‘ve also come to value prevention more, and increasingly look to natural
                supplements and other products from ethical and sustainable brands to support our health every day.

                A healthy diet, exercise and sleep are the key cornerstones to maintaining good health and strong
                defences. When it comes to diet, there are many nutrients that have been shown to effectively support
                specific health concerns that are not easy to obtain from our regular food sources, or provided by
                multivitamins.

        <h3>The Update On Endometriosis</h3> <br> <br>
        <img src="photo/uterus.jpg"> <br> <br>


        <p><span style="opacity: 0.7;">By Rosalind Ryan</span> <br>
            A new blood test could detect endometriosis in 90% of cases. But can it change the problems around how we
            treat it? <br> <br>

            If we told you there was a painful health condition that affects up to two million women in the UK, takes
            around seven and a half years to diagnose, costs the economy £8.2bn a year in lost working days, and can
            lead to infertility, you’d think we’d invented a Handmaid’s Tale style medical disorder. But it’s real and
            it’s endometriosis.

            What is endometriosis?
            ‘It’s a condition where the cells lining the womb get into the wrong places, such as the ovaries and
            Fallopian tubes,’ says Dr Jan Toledano of the London Hormone Clinic. ‘When the womb lining grows and breaks
            down, those stray cells do as well, causing severe pelvic pain.’ This pain can be bad enough to interfere
            with your everyday life, leaving you stuck in bed, unable to work or even see your friends and family.
