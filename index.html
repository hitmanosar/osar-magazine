                <h3>US News
                    Elon Musk gives date for when humans will arrive on Mars</h3>
                <hr>

                <p class="latestp"> The space race in search of the human being to set foot on Mars is still underway,
                    but the calculated times for this to be achieved are being delayed, as the entrepreneur Elon Musk
                    has
                    implied with a very clear message.

                    The CEO and founder of SpaceX is working for his Starship spacecraft to reach the red planet,
                    as his plans even aim to establish a city on Mars and in his first statements in this regard, said
                    in December 2020, he calculated that this milestone would be achieved between 2024 and 2026.

                    However, Musk and SpaceX have had to overcome several obstacles, such as the lawsuit filed by Blue
                    Origin, Jeff Bezos' U.S. aerospace transportation company, against NASA.

                    The reasons for this lawsuit are due to the multi-million dollar contract NASA awarded SpaceX to
                    develop Starship. </p>

                <h3>Mark Zuckerberg’s advice for young people: Focus more on building relationships than being
                    ‘objective focused’
                </h3>
                <hr>

                <p class="latestp_f">Most people know Facebook’s dorm-room origin story. But according to Mark
                    Zuckerberg, you might have learned the wrong lesson from it.

                    On a recent episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman,
                    Zuckerberg said his initial ability to launch Facebook back in 2004 wasn’t because he dropped out of
                    college or abandoned any of his other interests. Rather, the Meta CEO said, it was due to the
                    personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college,
                    Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make on campus.
                    “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he explained.</p>

                <img src="photo/tokyo1.jpeg" class="l3 rounded"> <br> <br>
                <p> For decades, being a student in Tokyo meant you had to look a certain way. Under the public school
                    system's dress code, all students had to dye their hair black, certain hairstyles were prohibited
                    and even their underwear had to be a designated color.
                    But these rules, which have recently come under scrutiny and been criticized as outdated, will now
                    be abolished, the city's authorities announced this week.
                    A total of five rules will be dropped by nearly 200 public schools across the Japanese capital,
                    including regulations on hair and underwear color, and a ban on "two block" hairstyles, which are
                    long on top and short at the back and sides a style currently in fashion in many countries.
                    Other rules being cut include the practice of punishing students with a form of house arrest, and
                    ambiguous language in the guidelines on what is considered "typical of high school students."

                <img src="photo/earth.jpg" class="l3 rounded"> <br> <br>
                <p>While Wednesday's earthquake caused tsunami waves just 8 inches (0.2 meters) high, the 2011 quake
                    triggered 30-foot (9.1 meters) waves that damaged several nuclear reactors in the area.
                    The 2011 disaster left more than 22,000 dead or missing, from the initial earthquake, tsunami and
                    post-disaster health conditions. As of last year, more than 35,000 people remained displaced, 10
                    years after the meltdown.
                    The cleanup is expected to last decades and cost billions of dollars.
                    Since 2011, Japan has stepped up its response systems to better deal with such disasters, including
                    improving early earthquake
                    warning systems and seismic observation technology.
                    Could more earthquakes or tsunamis come?
                    Japan's Meteorological Agency warned the public to stay alert for aftershocks and the possible risk
                    of mudslides or landslides. It also urged people in affected areas to stay away from the coast and
                    not get into the sea.</p>

                <p>Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic,
                    so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development.
                    WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective
                    vaccines.

                    Safe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must
                    continue wearing masks,
                    cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds.

                    Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at
                    risk,
                    particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against
                    disease but also against
                    infection and transmission.

                    See WHO’s landscape of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for the latest information on vaccines in
                    clinical
                    and pre-clinical development, generally updated twice a week. </p>

                <p>Chelsea booked our place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League with a 2-1 away win over Lille
                    in the second leg of our last-16 tie, completing a 4-1 victory on aggregate.
                    On the Evening Standard's player ratings, the highest marks for Chelsea players go to Rüdiger,
                    Azpilicueta, Pulišić and Jorginho - all given 7/10. The latter in particular bounced back from
                    conceding the penalty with a moment of class to set up Pulišić's goal. </p>

                <h5>Fantasy Basketball Category Analysis: Week 23</h5> <br>
                <p>Which players should fantasy owners pick up if looking for help in certain categories? Take a look at
                    the Week 23 list from FantasyPros.
                    Every week, we’ll be looking at players who are widely available and rostered in fewer than 60
                    percent of fantasy leagues on Yahoo. We’ll be focusing on 8-cat leagues because turnovers are a
                    waste of a category, to be honest.

                    SINGAPORE: Technology company Dyson will invest S$1.5 billion in its Singapore operations over the

                    Friday (Mar 25).

                    "Dyson's expansion here is possible because of the wonderful inventiveness and enthusiasm of the

                <h3>Bangkok (CNN) — Officials in Thailand have just reopened one of the country's most famous
                    attractions.</h3> <br>

                <p>Maya Bay, a beautiful cove made famous by "The Beach" a 2000 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio began
                    welcoming tourists on January 1, 2022 for the first time in more than three years.
                    The popular destination has been off limits to tourists since June 2018 as officials embarked on a
                    rejuvenation program aimed at reviving the popular area's decimated corals.
                    These destinations were overwhelmed by tourists. Here's how they're doing now
                    Located in Thailand's Hat Noppharat Thara-Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park, Maya Bay is part of Phi Phi
                    Leh one of the two main Phi Phi islands in Krabi province.
                    Unlike the much larger Phi Phi Don, home to an abundance of budget and mid-range accommodation
                    options, Phi Phi Leh was only open to day-trip visitors prior to the closure of Maya Bay.
                    But it's been one of the country's most famous attractions over the last two decades, thanks much in
                    part to the global success of "The Beach," part of which was filmed there.</p>


                <p>On a CNN visit to the area several weeks prior to its closure, visitor numbers multiplied by the
                    minute as boats poured in and out of the bay. Many visitors to the area were day-trippers from
                    Phuket, which is less than an hour's ride away by speedboat. According to official figures, the bay
                    was receiving an estimated 5,000 visitors per day on average in 2018.</p>
